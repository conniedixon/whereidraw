      <h4>Hello,</h4>
      <p>
        my name is Ricky and I'm a freelance Illustrator currently living and
        working in Leeds. I love creating artwork that clings to reality by its
        fingertips to tell a story. And I really enjoy the challenge of
        combining elements that you would never usually see together in real
        life to achieve thought provoking new concepts. When I'm not found with
        a pen in hand you can find me out in nature walking my dog, sat in the
        pub with a beer and some friends or occasionally battling imaginary
        goblins in a dungeons and dragons campaign.
